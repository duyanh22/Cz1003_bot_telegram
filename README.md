""In the 21st century, our education systems have evolved from the one-dimensional, examinations-based curriculum into a more dynamic and holistic environment for youths to develop themselves. Modern education around the world has slowly shifted their focus towards a more comprehensive structure that emphasises more on friendly competition and cooperation. Curriculums have become less examination-oriented and more project-based. This helps students in developing the proper interpersonal skills to prepare them for work in the future. In Singapore, project work is deemed so important that junior college students taking the GCE ‘A’ level examinations are required to take up Project Work as an examinable subject where students are required to work in groups to produce a written report and a presentation over the course of a year. Of course, when it comes to other tertiary education institutions such as polytechnics and universities, proficiency in project work is also a fundamental skill that students must have to get through their individual courses.""
